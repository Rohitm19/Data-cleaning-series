    "5.1 Dealing with Duplicate Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Introduction:\n",
    "Duplicate data is a common issue in datasets that can lead to skewed analysis and inaccurate insights. It occurs when identical or near-identical rows exist in a dataset, often as a result of data entry errors, merging datasets, or automated data collection processes. Addressing duplicates is essential to ensure the quality and reliability of your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Definition:\n",
    "Duplicate data refers to instances in which two or more identical or nearly identical rows appear in a dataset. These duplicates can include exact matches across all columns or partial matches in specific columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Objective:\n",
    "The primary objective of dealing with duplicate data is to identify, analyze, and eliminate any redundant information in the dataset. This process ensures that the data used in analysis or modeling is accurate and free from unnecessary repetition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Importance:\n",
    "Handling duplicate data is crucial because duplicates can distort statistical analysis, lead to incorrect conclusions, and reduce the efficiency of data processing. Removing or correctly handling duplicates helps maintain data integrity, leading to more reliable and meaningful insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.2 Techniques for Handling Duplicate Data\n",
    "1. Identifying Duplicates:\n",
    "   Identifying duplicates involves detecting rows in the dataset that are exactly or nearly identical.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Removing Duplicates:\n",
    "   Removing duplicates refers to the process of deleting repeated rows to clean the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Handling Partial Duplicates:\n",
    "   This technique involves managing rows that have identical values in some columns but differ in others.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Fuzzy Matching for Near Duplicates:\n",
    "   Fuzzy matching identifies rows that are not exactly identical but are similar enough to be considered duplicates."
