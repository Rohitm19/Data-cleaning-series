    "5.1 Dealing with Duplicate Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Introduction:\n",
    "Duplicate data is a common issue in datasets that can lead to skewed analysis and inaccurate insights. It occurs when identical or near-identical rows exist in a dataset, often as a result of data entry errors, merging datasets, or automated data collection processes. Addressing duplicates is essential to ensure the quality and reliability of your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Definition:\n",
    "Duplicate data refers to instances in which two or more identical or nearly identical rows appear in a dataset. These duplicates can include exact matches across all columns or partial matches in specific columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Objective:\n",
    "The primary objective of dealing with duplicate data is to identify, analyze, and eliminate any redundant information in the dataset. This process ensures that the data used in analysis or modeling is accurate and free from unnecessary repetition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Importance:\n",
    "Handling duplicate data is crucial because duplicates can distort statistical analysis, lead to incorrect conclusions, and reduce the efficiency of data processing. Removing or correctly handling duplicates helps maintain data integrity, leading to more reliable and meaningful insights."
