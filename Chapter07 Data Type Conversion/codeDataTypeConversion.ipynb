    "7.1 Introduction\n",
    "Data type conversion, also known as data type casting, is the process of transforming data from one type to another. This is essential in data preprocessing to ensure that data is in the correct format for analysis, modeling, or storage. Converting data types allows for more efficient data handling and can prevent errors in further processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Definition\n",
    "Data type conversion involves changing the data type of a variable from one form (e.g., string, integer, float) to another. This can be done to standardize data, make it compatible with specific functions or models, or correct data entry errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Objective\n",
    "A. The objectives of data type conversion include:\n",
    "B. Ensuring data consistency across the dataset.\n",
    "C. Preparing data for specific types of analysis or operations.\n",
    "D. Correcting incorrect data types to prevent processing errors.\n",
    "E. Optimizing data storage and computational efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "Importance\n",
    "Accuracy: Ensures that data is in the correct format for analysis.\n",
    "Compatibility: Makes data suitable for use with specific tools, models, or algorithms.\n",
    "Efficiency: Optimizes memory usage and processing speed by using appropriate data types.\n",
    "Error Prevention: Reduces the likelihood of errors caused by incompatible or incorrect data types.\n",
