# 📊 **Data Cleaning Series: A Comprehensive Guide to Data Wrangling in Python**

Welcome to the **Data Cleaning Series**, a project designed to cover essential data cleaning techniques to transform raw datasets into well-structured, insightful, and high-quality data. This repository is a collection of Jupyter Notebooks that demonstrate how to handle common data issues using Python libraries like **pandas**, **numpy**, and **fuzzywuzzy**.

---

## 📝 **Overview**
Data cleaning is a critical step in data analysis and machine learning projects. This series is aimed at both beginners and experienced data professionals looking to enhance their data wrangling skills. The project is divided into chapters, each focused on a specific technique necessary for preparing data for analysis.

---

## 🔍 **Chapters**
Each chapter covers a key concept of data cleaning with detailed explanations and code examples.

1. **Chapter 1: Handling Missing Values**  
   Techniques for handling missing data, including removal, imputation, and advanced predictive modeling methods.

2. **Chapter 2: Handling Outliers**  
   How to identify and treat outliers using methods such as Z-scores and IQR.

3. **Chapter 3: Data Transformation**  
   Techniques for transforming data, including normalization, standardization, and encoding categorical variables.

4. **Chapter 4: Data Parsing and Text Data Cleaning**  
   Extracting meaningful components from raw text data and performing basic text data cleaning.

5. **Chapter 5: Dealing with Duplicate Data**  
   How to identify and remove duplicate records using exact and fuzzy matching techniques.

6. **Chapter 6: Data Validation**  
   Implementing checks to ensure data consistency and integrity.

7. **Chapter 7: Data Type Conversion**  
   Converting data types and ensuring appropriate formats for analysis.

8. **Chapter 8: Addressing Data Entry Errors**  
   Correcting common data entry errors such as typos and inconsistent formats.

9. **Chapter 9: Handling Inconsistent Data**  
   Merging and cleaning inconsistent data formats and categories.

10. **Chapter 10: Data Enrichment and Feature Engineering**  
    Enhancing datasets with external information and creating new features for analysis.
